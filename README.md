Jvalley is a farming simulation game motivated by [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) and [Harvest Moon DS: Grand Bazaar](https://www.bokumono.com/series/kazebaza/). This game is developed with [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/). The demo website is available [here](https://ioneone.github.io/jvalley/).

Now the world is crazy with Corona viruses and I'm allowed to take my classes with P/NP options for major requrirements, I have more spare time to spend for something fun. I developed games twice in the past -- [GameEngine3D](https://github.com/ioneone/GameEngine3D) and [Museum 3D](https://github.com/ioneone/Museum-3D). GameEngine3D was based on LWJGL (Java version of OpenGL) and Museum 3D was based on WebGL (JavaScript version of OpenGL). While these libraries are great for 3D games, they are overkill for 2D games. Developing a 3D game is very time consuming and make the development quite a pain in my experience. Searching through the web I found Phaser 3 is one of the best gaming library for JavaScript. JavaScript is nice because it runs on the browser and make the deployment process easy. Phaser 3 is a wrapper library for WebGL. Although we may lose some flexibility WebGL provides, Phaser makes the game development relatively more straightforward. The developers can focus more on the game logic rather than rendering techniques. 
Jvalley also serves as a demonstration of what I am capable of as a Software Engineer because game is one of the most complicated software you can build. But the nice thing about this softare is that it is fun to build such a program. 

## Development

You can play the game locally by downloading the repository and run

```bash
npm install && npm start
```

## Development Logs

Dev logs are available [here](https://github.com/ioneone/jvalley/tree/develop/logs). The logs also serve as the documentation of the code base as well as references for people who want to develop games with Phaser 3 as there are not enough tutorials avaialble online.
