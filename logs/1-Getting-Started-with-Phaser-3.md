# Getting Started with Phaser 3

Phaser 3 is a JavaScript game framework. This is a great tool to use because 
you don't have to worry too much about the graphics rendering and focus more 
on developing the game. However, there aren't many tutorials that cover the 
usage of this library, so it's not easy to get started as beginners. 

The goal of this development log is to serve as a comprehensive reference on 
how to use Phaser 3. I collected some useful resources scatter all over the web
into one place so you don't have to suffer. Now, let's dive into the world of 
game development with Phaser 3!

## Getting Your Hand Dirty

If you haven't already, I recommend you go over the Phaser's [Marking your first Phaser 3 game](https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1) tutorial series. You will probably notice that the code you write there is pretty 
much a spaghetti code. They recently published another tutorial series ([Modern JavaScript Phaser 3 Tutorial](https://phaser.io/news/2020/04/modern-javascript-phaser-3-tutorial-part-1)) that 
introduce a more modular way to write Phaser 3 application.

## Environemnt Setup

I would like to introduce a more powerful tools for developing a Phaser 3 game.
In particular, I want to be able to 

1. Write the code in TypeScript
2. Bundle the source code for deployment

Fortunately, someone already made a template for us! You can checkout these templates. 

- [Phaser 3 Parcel TypeScript Template](https://github.com/vickylance/phaser3-parcel-ts-starter)
- [Phaser 3 Rollup TypeScript Template](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-typescript-project-template)

I will be using the parcel template. If everything works, you will probably see
a plain black screen.
