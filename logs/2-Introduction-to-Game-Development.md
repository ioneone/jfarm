# Phaser 3 Game Development Resources

In this tutorial, you will learn some of the important concepts and tools for 
game development.

## Phaser Documentation and Community

The [documentation](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/#toc3__anchor) provides detailed descriptions about the APIs. But this is useful only if you 
know what functions you need to use. Often times, you don't even know what API
to use. I would say just Google the problem. I frequently find the solutions 
at HTML5 Game Devs Forum, Stack Overflow, and [Phaser 3 Examples](https://phaser.io/examples). 

If you are still stuck, there is a [Phaser discord channel](https://phaser.io/community/discord) where you can ask for help!

## Where to Get Game Assets

You can find game assets at places like [itch.io](https://itch.io/) or [opengameart.org](https://opengameart.org/). But if you are a poor student like myself, you probably don't want to spend any dimes on them for a simple game. In that case, I recommend checking out Liberated Pixel Cup (LPC) from OpenGameArt. LPC assets are free high quality sprites with many contributers. The nice thing about LPC assets is that all of them follow an universal style guide, so LPC assets from two different sources will still look natural when they are put together.

You can find full list of LPC assets at OpenGameArt website. There are also some github repositories for LPC assets.

## Texture Packer

[Texture Packer](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker) is a software (not free) for making a spritesheet from bunch of images. The key feature of Texture packer is making a texture atlas. Texture atlas is like a more efficient version of spritesheet, but it's an overkill for a simple game I will be making. Instead you can just use [Sprite Sheet Packer](https://www.codeandweb.com/free-sprite-sheet-packer), which is free.

## Tiled

[Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) is a free map editor for 2D games. You can check out [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwaomOYGuYo) to learn how to use Tiled. Also check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgfygQoW4q0) to learn how to do [auto tile](https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/auto-tiles-in-tiled-parallax-mapping-made-easier.97739/) with Tiled.

To learn how to integrate a map made with Tiled, you can read [this turorial](https://medium.com/@michaelwesthadley/modular-game-worlds-in-phaser-3-tilemaps-1-958fc7e6bbd6).
